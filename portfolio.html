                    <h1> Sabi Sushi </h1>
                    <p> This is my  first website I made.
                    <p>  Some of my most famous foods can be found here. </p> 
                    <p> To design this website I had to work continously for days.  </p>
                    <p> So first off I started  designing the navigation bar, I wanted to make it as simple and accesible as possible.</p>
                    <p> Making the navigation bar made making the website much easier. </p>
                    <a href="https://sabi.no/"> Press this link to view my most popular website called Sabi Sushi</a>

                    <h1>Fashion Icon</h1>
                    <p>I am known for being different through my music. The thing is my dressing sense is also different from everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <p> Vogue is a pretty well known magazine, and at that fashion week I wore an outfit that was extremely extraordinary as you can see.</p>
                    <p> I am well liked, because I don`t care about what others think about me</p>
                    <p> I got praise, because I am the only one who can pull an outfit like this off.</p>

                    <h1>Self-driving car</h1>
                    <p>This is a car I made in the last year of my studying career.</p>
                    <p> This car is based on a book itself that was written by Elon Musk </p>
                    <p> The book itself is about a 17-year old student who is inspired by a self-driving car.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>This car was well critically well received. It got a 8.8 on Google reviews and on Tripadvisor 82% liked the car.</p>
