                <h1>Our Project</h1>
                <p> To design this website we layed out primarily 4 websites. First off we designed our navigation bar in a userfriendly way. We used flex to lay out the navigation bar and css to customize it to make it look smoother. While making the portfolio we decided that we wanted to show 3 projects all right next to eachother. That's why we chose 3 pictures and used css to place them next to eachother. In our resume we used the same approach, but we listed languages etc. below. We decided to make a fictional persona that described one of our group members to some extent.
